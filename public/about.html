<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a senior undergraduate student at 
  the University of California, Irvine,
   majoring in Computer Science.
    My academic journey has equipped me with extensive 
    knowledge in object-oriented programming, 
    algorithm analysis, and data structures.
     Throughout my academic years,
      I have worked with a diverse set of
       programming languages and technologies, 
       including C++, C, Java, Python, JSON, 
       HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, DAX, and R.</p>
  <p>My strong motivation drives me to continually 
  acquire new skills and enhance my existing ones.
   Beyond my coursework, I have actively engaged
    in extracurricular activities, such as a Software Engineering
     internship at Parker Hannifin and volunteering as a Supplemental
      Instructional Leader at Glendale Community College. 
      These experiences have further enriched my practical 
      knowledge and allowed me to apply my skills in real-world contexts.</p>
